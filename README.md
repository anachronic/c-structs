# C structs for general use

This repository is intended to hold many useful C structs for general use. The implementation of these structs are no secret to anyone that has some computer science knowledge, and so this repository is licensed under the MIT license.

## There are many other repositories

Yes, there are many other repositories that offer the same thing, I know.

I just wanted to do this one because of the eternal boredom I'm going through right now in college, where they make me code in Python or they don't make me code at all, which I think is pretty bad...

So, in short, this repository is merely for fun.

## What should I find here?

Any kind of data structure (and it's algorithms, of course) for **general** use. This means all the structures should be *generic*, and not type-specific. Every function that searches or returns any kind of element should be a `void*` unless the struct is specific for some data-type like Tries or whatever (well, actually Tries can be used for other data types, but you get the point).

There's not much right now, I know, I'll be working on it the next several months.

## Coding style

Pretty simple, either `linux` or `k&r`. `gnu` is NOT ALLOWED AT ALL. I mean this in a *pull request* sense.

## Pending work

For now I intend to get working these structures:

* Splay Trees
* AVL Trees
* Red Black trees

On a not-so-near future:

* Hash tables
* Tries
* Huffman code trees
